This is just a simple C library I wrote to use FCPv2 from a C program.
It's quite basic at the moment, however I plan to put another layer ontop of this library so that errors are handled automagicly, and string processing is done a little more efficiently.
The API/ABI may well change, so don't depend on it too much.

If you found a bug, have a question, or some sugestions, email me at jbit@jbit.net

Have fun
